# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript examples and exercises, likely from a 30-day coding challenge. It covers a wide range of JavaScript topics, from fundamental concepts to more advanced features. There is also a TypeScript file exploring functions.

## Topics Covered

The JavaScript files in this repository cover the following topics:

*   Basics (variables, data types, console output)
*   Strings and string manipulation
*   Operators and Date object
*   Conditionals (if/else, switch)
*   Arrays
*   Loops (for, while, do...while)
*   Functions (declaration, expression, arrow, HOFs)
*   Objects
*   Classes (ES6 style and traditional `js7bClasses.js`)
*   Sets and Maps
*   Destructuring and Spreading
*   Regular Expressions
*   Console Object methods
*   Error Handling
*   JSON
*   Promises and Asynchronous JavaScript
*   Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation
*   Event Listeners
*   New JavaScript Features (unspecified, from `js19NewFeatures.js`)
*   Best Practices
*   One-Liners
*   Code Snippets
*   Tips & Tricks

Additionally, there is a TypeScript file:

*   `ts1Functions.ts`: Explores functions in TypeScript.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
3.  **Run the JavaScript files:**
    Most of the `.js` files can be run directly using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node <filename>.js
    ```
    For files involving DOM manipulation (e.g., `js17DOM.js`, `js18EventListeners.js`), you will need to open an HTML file that includes the script in a web browser.
4.  **Run the TypeScript file:**
    You'll need the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) installed.
    ```bash
    tsc ts1Functions.ts
    node ts1Functions.js
    ```
